Discuss political issues and produce from that a resolution that increases peace in the world and is accepted by all representatives. If no resolution is accepted by all representatives, the discussion continues.

## Mediator

Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed representatives of the United Nations,

As we gather here today, our goal is to engage in a constructive dialogue that will lead to a resolution aimed at increasing global peaceâ€”a resolution that we hope will be accepted by all member states. To ensure that our conversation remains focused and productive, I will facilitate the discussion, guiding it towards consensus and mutual understanding.

Let us begin by identifying the key political issues that currently impact global peace. I invite each representative to briefly outline what they see as the most pressing concerns in their region or globally that require our collective attention. Please keep your statements concise to allow time for all voices to be heard.

Once we have a list of issues, we will prioritize them and discuss potential solutions. Remember, the aim is to find common ground and work towards a resolution that reflects the shared values and interests of the international community.

If at any point the conversation diverges into too many parallel threads, I will step in to park certain threads for later discussion. Conversely, if we find ourselves lacking in topics, I will suggest new ones that are pertinent to our mission.

Let us proceed with respect, open-mindedness, and a commitment to peace. Who would like to begin by addressing the assembly?

## RussiaRep

As the representative of Russia, I would like to contribute to this discussion by highlighting several key issues that we believe are critical to the pursuit of global peace.

Firstly, we must address the issue of international security and disarmament. The proliferation of weapons, particularly nuclear weapons, poses a significant threat to global stability. Russia advocates for the strengthening of international treaties and agreements that aim to control and reduce the number of nuclear weapons worldwide.

Secondly, we believe that respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states is fundamental to maintaining international peace. This includes non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations and the peaceful resolution of disputes.

Thirdly, the fight against terrorism remains a top priority. We must enhance international cooperation to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. This includes sharing intelligence, blocking financial support to terrorist groups, and countering extremist ideologies.

Lastly, we must address the root causes of conflict, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to resources. Russia supports initiatives that promote sustainable development, economic growth, and social inclusion to create a more stable and peaceful world.

We are ready to engage in constructive dialogue with all parties to find solutions that are acceptable to everyone and that prioritize the interests of peace and security. Thank you.

## ChinaRep

As the representative of China, I appreciate the points raised by my Russian counterpart and would like to add China's perspective on the issues that are crucial for the enhancement of global peace.

Firstly, China emphasizes the importance of multilateralism and the central role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security. We believe that unilateral actions often undermine collective efforts and lead to increased tensions.

Secondly, China is committed to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations and advocate for peaceful dialogue and negotiation to resolve international disputes.

Thirdly, economic development is a key driver of peace. China supports initiatives that promote connectivity, infrastructure development, and economic cooperation, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to foster international collaboration and shared prosperity.

Fourthly, we must address climate change as a global security threat. China is taking significant steps to reduce carbon emissions and supports international efforts to combat climate change through cooperation and the transfer of green technologies.

Lastly, China believes in the importance of cultural and people-to-people exchanges to enhance mutual understanding and trust between nations, which is a foundation for lasting peace.

China is ready to work with all parties to develop a resolution that reflects these principles and contributes to a harmonious and stable international order. Thank you.

## USARep

As the representative of the United States, I thank my colleagues from Russia and China for their contributions. The United States is committed to fostering global peace and security, and we recognize the complexity of the challenges we face. In the spirit of cooperation, I would like to address the points raised and offer additional perspectives.

Firstly, the United States agrees that nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament are critical to global security. We support the continuation and strengthening of international agreements that aim to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and reduce existing stockpiles in a verifiable manner.

Secondly, while we uphold the principle of sovereignty, we also recognize the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. We must ensure that sovereignty is not used as a shield for states to commit human rights abuses against their own people.

Thirdly, the United States is at the forefront of the fight against terrorism. We advocate for a comprehensive approach that includes not only military and intelligence cooperation but also efforts to counter violent extremism through education, economic development, and the promotion of human rights.

Fourthly, we concur that addressing the root causes of conflict is essential. The United States supports initiatives that promote democracy, good governance, and the rule of law, as these are the foundations of stable and peaceful societies.

Fifthly, we agree that economic development is a cornerstone of peace. The United States encourages fair and reciprocal trade, investment in innovation, and the protection of intellectual property rights to ensure that economic growth benefits all.

Lastly, on the issue of climate change, the United States is committed to taking action and working with the international community to address this existential threat. We support the transition to a sustainable and clean energy future and the need for collective action to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

The United States is prepared to engage constructively with all nations to develop a resolution that addresses these issues in a balanced and effective manner, always with the goal of promoting peace, security, and prosperity for all. Thank you.

## ChinaRep

As the representative of China, I acknowledge the efforts made by the Secretary in drafting this resolution. China supports the spirit of the resolution and its comprehensive approach to promoting global peace. However, I would like to propose a few amendments to ensure that the resolution aligns with China's principles and interests:

1. Under point 1, China suggests adding language that emphasizes the importance of dialogue and mutual trust in the process of nuclear disarmament. It is crucial that the legitimate security concerns of all countries are taken into account.
2. Regarding point 2, China would like to see a stronger emphasis on the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of states. While we recognize the responsibility to protect, it must not be used as a pretext for violating national sovereignty.
3. In point 4, China proposes to include specific mention of the Belt and Road Initiative as an example of international cooperation that promotes connectivity and sustainable development.
4. On point 7, China recommends that the resolution should stress the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in combating climate change. Developed countries should take the lead in reducing emissions and providing support to developing countries.
5. Lastly, China believes that the monitoring mechanism mentioned in point 9 should operate with full respect for the sovereignty of member states and should be based on objective and impartial assessments.

## RussiaRep

As the representative of Russia, I would like to express our support for the draft resolution presented by the Secretary, which reflects a balanced approach to the promotion of global peace. We appreciate the inclusion of our concerns and the concerns of other member states in the draft.

In the spirit of cooperation and to ensure that the resolution is in line with Russia's principles and interests, I propose the following amendments:

1. Regarding point 1, Russia agrees with the representative of China on the need for dialogue and mutual trust in nuclear disarmament efforts. We propose adding a clause that calls for the preservation and strengthening of existing arms control treaties, which are crucial for maintaining strategic stability.

3. In point 3, Russia would like to see a more explicit commitment to the principle of equal and indivisible security for all states, which is essential for effective counter-terrorism cooperation.
4. For point 7, Russia believes that the resolution should recognize the importance of energy security and the right of states to choose their own path to a sustainable energy future, taking into account national circumstances.
5. Concerning the monitoring mechanism in point 9, Russia agrees with the representative of China that it should operate with full respect for the sovereignty of member states and be based on objective and impartial assessments.

## USARep

As the representative of the United States, I commend the Secretary for the comprehensive draft resolution and acknowledge the amendments proposed by my colleagues from China and Russia. The United States is committed to working collaboratively to refine this resolution to reflect our shared goals for peace and security.

We believe that these treaties are foundational to strategic stability and international security.
2. Regarding point 2, the United States understands the concerns about non-interference and supports the use of established international mechanisms for conflict resolution.

However, we must also emphasize the urgency of addressing climate change and the need for collective action to reduce emissions and promote sustainable practices.

We propose that the mechanism also includes provisions for transparency and accountability to ensure that progress can be effectively measured and reported.
