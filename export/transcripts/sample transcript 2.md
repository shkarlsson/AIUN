Discuss a current political issue and produce from that a resolution that increases peace in the world and is accepted by all representatives. If no resolution is accepted by all representatives, the conversation continues.

## Mediator

Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed representatives of the United Nations,

As we gather here today, let us focus our efforts on a pressing political issue that affects global peace and security: the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, particularly the situation in Syria. This conflict has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people displaced and in need of assistance.

To move towards a resolution that increases peace in the world and is acceptable to all, we must address several key points:

1. **Ceasefire and De-escalation**: We need to discuss the establishment of a sustainable ceasefire across all parties involved in the conflict. This would include the withdrawal of foreign forces and support for a UN-monitored de-escalation zone.
2. **Humanitarian Access and Aid**: Ensuring that humanitarian organizations have unfettered access to provide aid to those in need is crucial. This includes medical assistance, food, and shelter for displaced individuals.
3. **Political Process**: We must support a political process that is inclusive and Syrian-led, which will lead to a peaceful and democratic transition that reflects the will of the Syrian people.
4. **Reconstruction and Development**: Post-conflict reconstruction is essential for long-term peace. We need to discuss how the international community can support rebuilding infrastructure and the economy in a way that benefits all Syrians.
5. **Accountability**: There must be accountability for war crimes and human rights abuses committed during the conflict. This could involve support for international tribunals or other mechanisms for justice.

I invite each representative to share their country's perspective on these points, and let us work together to draft a resolution that embodies our collective commitment to peace. Please, let us proceed with the discussion in a respectful and constructive manner, focusing on common ground and shared human values.

If at any point the conversation diverges into less productive or repetitive areas, I will gently steer us back on track. If new information is required, I will request it from our research team. Let us begin with the first point of discussion: establishing a ceasefire and de-escalation. Who would like to speak first?

## RussiaRep

Esteemed Mediator and fellow representatives,

Regarding the situation in Syria, Russia has consistently advocated for a peaceful resolution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic. We support a ceasefire and de-escalation of the conflict, provided that it does not compromise the fight against recognized terrorist organizations that pose a threat to the stability of Syria and the security of the region.

We believe that any ceasefire should be contingent upon the cooperation of all parties involved and should be monitored by the United Nations to ensure compliance. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of respecting the legitimate government of Syria and coordinating efforts with them.

On the matter of humanitarian access and aid, Russia is in favor of providing assistance to the Syrian population. However, such aid must be delivered in a non-political manner, without being used as leverage by any party seeking to influence the internal affairs of Syria.

The political process must indeed be Syrian-led and should not be imposed externally. Russia supports the continuation of the Astana process and the work of the Constitutional Committee in Geneva, which aim to facilitate dialogue between the Syrian parties.

In terms of reconstruction and development, we are ready to contribute to rebuilding efforts that will help restore normalcy and prosperity for the Syrian people. This should be done in coordination with the Syrian government and without preconditions that demand political changes as a prerequisite for aid.

Lastly, accountability for war crimes is important, and any such efforts should be based on credible evidence and follow due process. It is essential that this does not become a tool for political manipulation.

Russia is committed to working with all parties to find a resolution that brings about peace while respecting the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter. We are open to constructive dialogue and cooperation towards this end.

Thank you.

## ChinaRep

Esteemed Mediator, distinguished representatives,

China aligns itself with the call for peace and stability in the Middle East, particularly in Syria. We believe that the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Syria must be respected. In the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, China supports a ceasefire and de-escalation that includes all parties and takes into account the complex realities on the ground.

We agree that a UN-monitored ceasefire could be beneficial, provided it respects the role of the Syrian government and does not impede the fight against terrorism, which remains a significant concern for regional and global security.

On humanitarian access, China emphasizes the importance of providing aid in a manner that is impartial and free from political motives. Humanitarian efforts should not be used as a tool to exert pressure on the Syrian government or any other party in the conflict. China is ready to provide humanitarian assistance within the framework of international cooperation.

The political process should indeed be Syrian-led and free from external interference. China supports the efforts of the United Nations in facilitating dialogue and negotiations among Syrian parties. The future of Syria must be decided by the Syrian people themselves, and the international community should play a constructive role in supporting this process.

Regarding reconstruction, China believes that the international community should assist Syria in its post-conflict recovery. This assistance should be coordinated with the Syrian government and should prioritize the well-being of the Syrian people, without attaching political conditions.

Accountability for any alleged war crimes is a serious matter. China supports a fair and just process that adheres to international law and respects the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of states.

China is committed to working with all parties to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Syria. We believe that dialogue and negotiation are the only viable paths to a lasting peace. China stands ready to engage in constructive discussions and to contribute to the peace process in a manner that promotes the common interests of peace, stability, and development.

Thank you.

## USARep

Esteemed Mediator, distinguished representatives,

The United States is deeply concerned about the ongoing conflict in Syria and its devastating impact on the Syrian people and regional stability. We are committed to finding a resolution that will lead to a lasting peace and alleviate the suffering of the Syrian population.

1. **Ceasefire and De-escalation**: The United States supports a comprehensive ceasefire that includes all parties to the conflict. We agree that a UN-monitored ceasefire is essential and that it should facilitate a conducive environment for a political solution while ensuring that the fight against terrorism continues effectively. We must ensure that any ceasefire agreement includes robust mechanisms for enforcement and accountability.
2. **Humanitarian Access and Aid**: The United States emphasizes the critical need for unimpeded humanitarian access to all areas of Syria. We are prepared to provide substantial humanitarian assistance and call on all parties to allow aid to reach those in need without discrimination or obstruction. The delivery of aid should be coordinated through the United Nations and other international agencies to ensure it is conducted impartially and apolitically.
3. **Political Process**: We support a Syrian-led political process that is facilitated by the United Nations and adheres to UN Security Council Resolution 2254. This process should lead to a credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance, followed by a new constitution and free and fair elections under UN supervision. The voice of all Syrians, including women and minorities, must be heard in this process.
4. **Reconstruction and Development**: The United States recognizes the need for reconstruction in Syria, but believes that significant reconstruction aid should be linked to a political process that is in line with UNSCR 2254 and led by a government that is committed to reform and accountability. We are willing to work with the international community to plan for the long-term reconstruction of Syria, ensuring that aid does not empower those who have perpetuated the conflict.
5. **Accountability**: The United States insists on accountability for war crimes and human rights abuses. We support efforts to document and bring to justice those responsible for atrocities in Syria. Any process must be impartial and transparent to ensure that justice is served for the victims of the conflict.

The United States is ready to engage constructively with all parties to achieve a resolution that respects the rights and dignity of the Syrian people. We believe that a peaceful, stable, and unified Syria is in the interest of the United States and the international community. We look forward to working with our partners to advance these objectives.

Thank you.

Esteemed representatives, the draft resolution presented by the Secretary is a reflection of our collective input and the shared desire to see an end to the conflict in Syria.

## RussiaRep

Esteemed Mediator, fellow representatives,

Russia acknowledges the efforts made in drafting the preliminary resolution and appreciates the inclusion of key points that align with our position on the Syrian conflict. We find the draft to be a solid foundation for a consensus, yet we would like to propose a few clarifications to ensure the resolution's effectiveness and adherence to the principles of international law.

1. **Ceasefire and De-escalation**: We agree with the call for a ceasefire and emphasize the need for clear definitions of terrorist organizations that are excluded from the ceasefire agreement. We propose that the resolution explicitly names these groups, in line with UN designations, to prevent any ambiguity.
2. **Humanitarian Access and Aid**: Russia insists that the coordination with the Syrian government is not merely to the extent possible but is a requirement for the delivery of aid. This is to ensure respect for Syria's sovereignty and to facilitate effective distribution of assistance.
3. **Political Process**: We support the Syrian-led political process and suggest that the resolution should more strongly affirm the non-interference of external actors in this process. The resolution should also recognize the efforts already made in the Astana process and the Constitutional Committee in Geneva.
4. **Reconstruction and Development**: We propose that the resolution should not condition reconstruction aid on political progress. Instead, it should encourage immediate support for rebuilding efforts that can provide relief and stability to the Syrian people.
5. **Accountability**: While we support accountability, we propose that the resolution should emphasize the need for any judicial processes to be carried out with the consent of the Syrian government and in accordance with the principles of state sovereignty.

Russia is prepared to engage in further discussions to refine these points and reach a mutually acceptable resolution. We remain committed to a diplomatic solution that respects the rights and sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic and ensures regional stability.

Thank you.

## ChinaRep

Esteemed Mediator and fellow representatives,

China appreciates the efforts made in drafting the preliminary resolution and recognizes the importance of each point raised in the pursuit of peace in Syria. We believe that the draft resolution provides a constructive basis for consensus, but we would like to offer some additional considerations to ensure the resolution is balanced and respects the principles of sovereignty and non-interference.

1. **Ceasefire and De-escalation**: China supports the call for a ceasefire and stresses the importance of a clear and practical framework for its implementation. We agree with the Russian representative that the resolution should clearly define which entities are recognized as terrorist organizations and are thus excluded from the ceasefire.
2. **Humanitarian Access and Aid**: We concur that humanitarian aid must be delivered impartially and without political conditions. Coordination with the Syrian government is essential to ensure the sovereignty of Syria is upheld and that aid reaches those in need effectively.
3. **Political Process**: China believes that the resolution should reinforce the principle that the political process must be Syrian-led and free from external imposition. The international community's role should be to support, not dictate, the outcomes of this process.
4. **Reconstruction and Development**: The resolution should encourage the international community to assist in Syria's reconstruction in a manner that is not contingent upon political progress. Reconstruction is a humanitarian imperative that should not be delayed.
5. **Accountability**: While accountability for war crimes is crucial, it is equally important to ensure that any measures taken are in line with international law and respect the sovereignty of the Syrian state. The resolution should emphasize these principles.

China is committed to working with all parties to refine the resolution and achieve a document that is acceptable to all. We believe that through constructive dialogue and mutual respect, we can contribute to the peace and stability of Syria and the region.

Thank you.

We are committed to working with all parties to refine the resolution to ensure it is effective and represents our shared goals.

We believe that this clarification will prevent misuse of the ceasefire and ensure that the fight against terrorism continues effectively.

We agree that the resolution should emphasize the non-interference of external actors in Syria's political process, while also ensuring that the process remains inclusive and representative of all segments of Syrian society.

However, we are open to discussing how to provide immediate humanitarian relief and support for stabilization efforts that can benefit the Syrian people in the short term.
5. **Accountability**: The United States insists on the importance of accountability for war crimes and human rights abuses. We agree that any judicial processes should be carried out in accordance with international law, and we support efforts to document these crimes and pursue justice through impartial and transparent mechanisms.
